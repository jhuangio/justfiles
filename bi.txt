. HOADHOC-2063: New Home Purchase logic not working as expected
  . The new home purchase logic is not working as needed. 
  . 1. If I select a date in the future I get a message that future dating is not allowed. 
       . However if I am quoting ahead of a closing I need to ability to enter a date in the future. 
  . 2. Also if I put the purchase date the same as the effective date, I am not able to continue because I don't get a green continue.
