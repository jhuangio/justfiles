Hi Nicole,

Thanks for getting back with me so fast on open positions.  

FYI - I was at Bankers Insurance from 7/24/17 - 11/13/17.  I was required to come in Saturday 11/11/17 for final production move of the PHO Quote System I worked on fixing bugs and adding enhancements for 3 months.  I was let go without warning on Monday, after the production move work day Saturday without pay.  I really believe my position was a contract to perm position but they structured it as per because they knew I was considering other offers at the time.  

Per our telephone conversation today, I added the following Bankers Insurance bullets for you to add to my current resume >>> 

01. Analyzed and solved front end Angular 4 and back end .NET Core Web API and iSeries CQRS Kilbana/Elasticsearch errors on the Production, QA and Dev servers.

02. Instrumental to the success of the New PHO Quote System release by successfully delivering bux fixes and backlog feature solutions in five Agile Sprints using JIRA, Confluence, TeamCity, BitBucket/SourceTree, and Octapus to move task from Angular 4 front end development, .NET Core Web API, .NET Core iSeries API CQRS GIT Version Control CI deployemnt to Docker containers for Elasticsearch.

03. Developed New Innovative Angular 4 Feature Solutions using Visual Studio Code, GIT, Angular CLI, *ngIf/*ngFor, PhotoShop/Illustrator, D3, CSS3, Flexbox, Bootstrap, Material Design, HTML5 templates, Rxjs Observables, and Reactive Form Validators to deliver responsive, user friendly form solutions praised by the Business Owner. 

Please email me after you receive this to confirm.
