Hi Jia,

I apologize for the delay! With the holidays and vacations there was a delay in the hiring. We are back on track and I would like to talk with you about the Integrations Developer role you applied for. Please send me your resume to DPiowaty@ashleyfurniture.com with the best time to reach you. 

Unfortunately we can't sponsor on this role.

Thank you, 

DeLaina Piowaty | Sr. Technical Recruiter
